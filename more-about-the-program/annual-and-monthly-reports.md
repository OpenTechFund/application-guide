# Annual & Monthly Reports

OTF produces reports on both an annual and monthly basis. Our annual report gives a holistic, bird’s eye view of OTF’s activities for a given year, including a look at our portfolio of supported projects and fellows; application data, such as the number of requests we received round-by-round, amount requested; and budget information, both specific to OTF and with respect to overall US government funding for Internet freedom. Access our annual reports here: [https://www.opentech.fund/results\#annual](https://www.opentech.fund/results#annual)

Our monthly reports provide a short \(1-2 pages\) look into notable highlights and milestones reached by actively OTF-supported projects, fellows, and labs during that month. You can find our monthly reports compiled here: [https://www.opentech.fund/results\#monthly](https://www.opentech.fund/results#monthly)
