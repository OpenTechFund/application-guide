# Common Ineligible Areas of Focus

OTF knows our applicants’ time is valuable so we aim to make our application process as transparent and straightforward as possible. Part of this also means being transparent about what we don’t fund so that applicants do not expend unnecessary time and resources submitting applications that fall outside of OTF’s remit. In order to better reflect our respect for an applicant’s time and effort in submitting an application, we have detailed below common types of proposed projects that we are unable or very rarely support. If your project falls within one of these categories, we encourage you to explore our alternative sources of support [resources](https://guide.opentech.fund/appendix-iv-alternative-sources-of-support) to identify a more suitable funder.

\*\*\*\*[**Providing Internet Connectivity**](../appendix-iv-alternative-sources-of-support.md#information-and-communications-technologies-for-development-ict-4-d-including-deploying-internet-access)\*\*\*\*

OTF does not provide support for basic connectivity except in limited cases around politically instigated internet shutdowns. Numerous U.S. Government programs outside of OTF provide support for bringing Internet connectivity to areas that have never had it previously. The framework OTF operates within ensures a clear distinction exists to protect against overlapping mandates which is why we do not support projects of this nature.

\*\*\*\*[**Information and Communication Technologies for Development \(ICT4D\)**](../appendix-iv-alternative-sources-of-support.md#information-and-communications-technologies-for-development-ict-4-d-including-deploying-internet-access)\*\*\*\*

OTF does not provide support for projects focused on harnessing technology for the purpose of societal development. Numerous U.S. Government programs exist to support civic technology projects that use technology to solve societal challenges, such as improving government delivery of services, providing equitable access to technologies and improving digital literacy across society. The OTF program is focused on assisting those exposed to censorship or surveillance in repressive environments.

\*\*\*\*[**Legal Analysis and Policy Advocacy**](../appendix-iv-alternative-sources-of-support.md#digital-rights)\*\*\*\*

OTF does not provide support for projects to improve the legal and policy landscape, outside of narrowly focused technical research to help inform these efforts. Numerous U.S. Government programs provide support for efforts to conduct legal analysis and improve advocacy for specific policies. The framework OTF operates within ensures a clear distinction exists to protect against overlapping mandates. In addition, these types of activities do not reflect the technology centric approach underlying the OTF program.
