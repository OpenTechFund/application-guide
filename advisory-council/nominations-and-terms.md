# Nominations and terms

## Nominations

New AC member nominations are formally presented by OTF team to existing AC members for feedback. At any time, the OTF team, existing AC members, and the general project can send nomination suggestions to the OTF team for consideration by emailing known team members or hello@opentech.fund. We may also do a formal and public call for suggested nominees as needed. Self-nominations are allowed and encouraged. We maintain a list of suggestions and will bring finalist as needed to the AC for their feedback before a final determination by OTFâ€™s Principal Director and then appointment.

### Criteria for consideration

## Terms

AC members serve as active reviewers for 1 year terms, with the ability to be renewed for additional years at the discretion of OTF and the AC member, during which time we hope AC members can be active in reviews and attend AC Calls \(more on that below\). We also hope that you are able to join us for the OTF summit the location of which changes each year - funding AC members travel to that event is one of the ways we try to say thanks for your participation. If the AC member and OTF agree, terms can be renewed for additional years. If an AC member wishes to no longer participate regularly, they will become an emeritus member. They can either notify an OTF team member or the whole team \(hello@opentech.fund\) or wait for the annual review of activity by OTF, where all AC members will be given the opportunity to transition. We hope that formerly active Emeritus members will continue to be boosters and informal advisors to OTF but no longer be obligated to perform regular proposal reviews. That said, Emeritus members can remain on the AC-Talk mailing list and selectively review proposals of particular interest.
