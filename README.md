# Welcome to our applicant and reviewer guide

The Open Technology Fund supports open technologies and communities that increase free expression, circumvent censorship, and obstruct repressive surveillance as a way to promote human rights and open societies.

To do so, we maintain an [open source application system](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund) to process the hundreds of applications we receive each month. Because we are a small team that can not possibly be in or outreach to all the places internet freedom is violated globally, or maintain all the expertise required in-house to know the best possible solutions, we do two things: have an always open application for new concept notes and maintain an Advisory Council, an all volunteer group of individuals who review our most competitive applications before our final determination. 

This guide is for them, applicants who are looking to apply, those that get approved, and the Advisory Council reviewing those applications.
