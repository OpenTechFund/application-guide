**This guide is designed for applicants applying to the Open Technology Fund \(OTF\) for funding, and also for newly approved projects and fellows. The goal is to provide you with all the information you need to successfully submit an application and to know what to expect if it is approved. The guidance provided herein is general and is relevant to all of the different funding solicitations published by OTF.

**What this guide **_**is**_** **_**not**_**          
**In addition to fitting within OTF's remit and one or more of our focus areas, each fund, lab, and fellowship program has its own specific criteria. This guide does not provide specific information for each individual funding mechanisms, but rather provides general guidelines relevant to any application to OTF. For information specific to individual funding mechanisms, each of these has its own dedicated request page. Links to those can be found [here](https://www.opentech.fund/requests).
