# ![](/assets/OTF Logo.jpeg)Application & Oversight Guide

This document is for new applicants and approved efforts. The goal is to provide the all the information needed to submit a great application and to know what to expect if it is approved. It should not provide specific information for individual solicitations \(that's what there requests are for\), but have a general higher-level relevance for all of the solicitations OTF manages.



This guide is intended for two primary audiences: 1\) new applicants seeking OTF funding and 2\) newly approved projects and fellows. 

**For Applicants **  
The goal of this guide is to provide you, the applicant, with all the information you need to submit a great application. This is your one-stop shop for understanding among other things general pointers about applying to OTF, our different funding mechanisms, how to best structure your concept note or proposal, and the application process workflow, for example.

**For Newly Approved Projects and Fellows  
**So your project or idea has been approved; now what? What happens next? Here, you can find out.
