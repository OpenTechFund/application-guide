# Application & Oversight Guide

This document is for new applicants and approved efforts. The goal is to provide the all the information needed to submit a great application and to know what to expect if it is approved. It should not provide specific information for individual solicitations \(that's what there requests are for\), but have a general higher-level relevance for all of the solicitations OTF manages.
