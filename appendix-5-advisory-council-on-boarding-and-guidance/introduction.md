# Introduction

Thank you for being apart of the the OTF Advisory Council and being crucial part of our application review process. We are excited you have with us and couldn’t do what we do with your participation. While the role is voluntary, the council plays a critical role in the OTF program. As an OTF AC member, you are a necessary check on our decision making process, an augmentation to OTF’s collective knowledge, and a trusted OTF liaison within our the communities we engage together.

We depend on you being an external and independent set of individuals as a primary grounding for our commitment of openness and non-competitive practices. The information and guidance we receive from outside experts like you in this role continues to raise vital considerations -- often for the first time -- during our decision making process. Through the trust you have in your own communities and the trust you have in OTF, you bring an important anchor of accountability to OTF. As an ambassador of OTF in those communities, you introduce OTF -- and vice versa -- to otherwise unreachable projects, fellows, or new initiatives to consider supporting.

The benefit is felt most by the applicants and those struggling on the front-lines. We consider it an honor and a primary role of ours to pass on what you give us to them. Time and time again, we hear from applicants how valuable the feedback is from OTF. We hear this equally from applicants who were dismissed and approved. We see the results with better first-time and new applications from people and places that surprise us. In return, we hope that you gain valuable insights on emerging solutions to tough and interesting challenges that align with your own interests.

This public document is meant to offer basic information to help AC members, applicants, and the general public understand the role they play for OTF. We recognize this document could be improved and encourage you to leave comments that will help us do so.
