# OTF Contract Template & USG Provisions

## Contract Template

OTF awards are performance-based contracts signed directly with the applicant. You can view an example template [here](https://www.opentech.fund/sites/default/files/page_attachment/otf_contract_template_final_0.pdf) \(pdf\). Payment is issued on completion of stated objectives, activities, and deliverables per a schedule outlined in the contract. OTF reserves the right to award less or more than the funds requested as deemed in the best interest of OTFâ€™s priorities.

## USG Provisions

OTF-supported efforts must agree to the Standard Provisions for US Government \(USG\)-Funded work. See [here](https://www.opentech.fund/sites/default/files/page_attachment/usgprovisions.pdf) \(pdf\).
