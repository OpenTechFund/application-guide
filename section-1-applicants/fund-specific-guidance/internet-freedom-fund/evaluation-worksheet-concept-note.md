# Evaluation Worksheet \(Concept Note\)

_Below is the worksheet used by OTF staff when evaluating concept notes._ 

**Goals and Principles**

Does the project contribute and/or have relevance to OTF goals and principles? Are the goals and objectives of the project clear? Is it a technology research, development, or deployment project? Can project’s effort be explained to external audiences and non-technical people? What problem are they trying to solve and is the solution strategical or tactical? Is the project strategically or tactically important to OTF’s goals, principles and rationale and other OTF efforts? Is it clear how? What tools, if any, currently exist to solve this problem? How is this project different? Does the effort have any overlap with existing OTF and/or USG supported projects? Is the overlap complementary or duplicative? If complementary, can it be explained clearly? I.e. geographic focus, technology, organization profile, etc. What are the liabilities and risks of taking on this project? I.e. political personalities, financial concerns, technical controversial, etc. Is the organization or its members known within any relevant communities? If yes, what is their reputation and why? What is the entity’s motivation and principles? What are the entity member\(s\) motivations and principles? Where is the organization physically and legally based? If the organization is distributed, where is the main point of contact? Does the organization have any conflicts of interest with RFA, OTF, the Advisory Council, or other RFA-OTF projects? Is the project team an organization, community or an individual?

Rate project's goals and principles: \(0-5\) \_\_\_\_\_

**Technical Merit**

Does the project clearly articulate the technical problem, solution, and approach? Is the problem clearly justifiable? Does the project clearly articulate the technological objectives? Is it an open or closed development project? I.e. Open source like Android or open source like Firefox OS or closed like iOS. Does a similar technical solution already exist? If so, what are the differentiating factors? Is the effort to sustain an existing technical approach? If so, are these considered successful? Is the effort a new technical approach or improvement to an existing solution? If so, how? Is the effort a completely new technical approach fostering new solutions in the field? Does the project’s technical approach solve the problem? What are the limitations of the project’s technical approach and solution? What are the unintended or illicit uses and consequences of this technology? Has the project identified and/or developed any safeguards for these consequences?

Rate project's technical merit: \(0-5\) \_\_\_\_\_

**Reasonable and Realistic**

Is the requested amount reasonable, realistic, and justified? Does the project provide a detailed and realistic description of effort and schedule? I.e. is the project capable of creating a work plan including objectives, activities, and deliverable\(s\)?

Rate the project in terms of how reasonable and realistic it is: \(0-5\) \_\_\_\_\_
