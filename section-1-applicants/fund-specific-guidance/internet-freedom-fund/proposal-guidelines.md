# Proposal Guidelines

_Below are general guidelines to consider before submitting a proposal to OTF. You can think of this as a template or outline when putting together your proposal. This information is based off OTF's observation of proposals that were well received and successfully passed the review process._ 

## Proposal Information

* Proposal title
* Requested funding amount in USD
* Project term in whole months e.g. 3, 6, 12, or 24
* Legal name \(This would be the name of the person or registered organization receiving funds from OTF\)
* Commonly used name \(This would be the name of the person or registered organization receiving funds from OTF\)
* Primary point of contact \(The person responsible for the project and support, if different from above\)
* Primary point of contact’s e-mail address and phone
* Address of the individual or organization including city, providence/state, postal code, and country

## Proposal Summary \(400 words recommended, 1000 words max\)

This a very brief statement of what this proposal is for. It should only be a few sentences and very succinct without jargon and for a broad audience. Consider this an executive summary or abstract.

## Proposal Narrative \(800 words recommended, 3000 words max\)

Describe the relevant political, economic, or social environment as it affects freedom of expression in the country or region that your project addresses. Identify the needs or problems that exist and explain how your project will make an impact as it addresses those challenges. Provide a synopsis of the proposed project goals, describe what is novel/revolutionary, and include answers to the following questions:

* What is the problem you hope to address?
* How is it done today? And, what are the limitations?
* What are you trying to do, using as little jargon as possible?
* What challenges will you confront during this effort?
* Who will care and what will the positive effect be if you are successful?

Includes a deep technical description \(if appropriate\):

Outline and address technical challenges inherent in the approach and possible solutions for overcoming potential problems. Discuss mitigation of technical risk. This section should demonstrate a deep understanding of the technical challenges and present a credible \(even if risky\) plan to achieve the effort’s goal. As applicable, this section should answer the following combination of Heilmeier and Internet freedom questions for each proposed capability/technology:

* What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives technically and succinctly.
* Explain what is new in the approach and why will it succeed?
* Describe how the proposed effort uniquely advances Internet Freedom and will ultimately assist freedom of speech and expression.
* Describe how the proposed effort increases or decreases censorship and where new censorship could occur because of this effort?
* Is the solution buying tactical breathing space for existing problems or driving toward convergence by changing the playing field?
* If the solution buys tactical breathing space, explain in a substantive way how the maximal amount of breathing space is gained for the minimal cost.
* If the solution drives toward convergence describe how the solution radically alters the landscape in ways to negate traditional adversary censorship approaches/efforts.
* How does this solution incentivize the adversary? If the solution were deployed, how might the adversary use the solution to further their own goals?
* What are potential unintended consequences of the proposed solution?
* What is the asymmetry for this solution? Given an attacker and defender of the proposal, explain which role is more advantageous \(effort, cost, time, etc.\) and why? Explain briefly for short, medium and long‐term strategies for both the attacker and defender point of view.
* If you were to have to defeat your own effort, how would you go about it? \(Note: it is perfectly acceptable to identify deficiencies in the effort. It is not acceptable to believe that there are none.\)
* Who could benefit from this technology? Be specific and cite an actual use case.

## Project Objectives \(500 words recommended, 2000 words max\)

State the specific objectives you hope to achieve through the proposed activities. In many situations, an objective is similar to a milestone. The objectives should address the specific needs or problems identified in earlier sections. Often, one to five objectives are sufficient. In most cases, OTF pays projects on completion of an objective.

This section should demonstrate a deep understanding of each objective, its challenges, and introduce a credible \(even if risky\) plan to achieve the objective. If the objective is technical, outline and address technical challenges inherent in the approach, possible solutions for overcoming potential problems, and discuss mitigation of technical risk.

Each objective should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound \(S.M.A.R.T.\): reasonably measurable, and therefore capable of being evaluated; limited in scope and time; and identify specifically what will be achieved with the funds requested for the particular project. Also, be sure to distinguish objectives from activities. For example, “to hold a workshop” is a proposed activity while “determine the online safety awareness and literacy of the population” is an objective.

## Budget Details \(500 words recommended, 2000 words max\)

Rationale for the proposal cost should provide a detailed breakout of how the money will be spent and how prices and rates were determined. Provide labor costs, miscellaneous expenses, materials, hardware, software, required to complete activities. Note, OTF pays on completion of activities and deliverables.

OTF may ask the proposer to justify listed rates by providing examples of equivalent rates for equivalent talent, past commercial or government rates, or previously approved rates.

Please list all materials, supplies, equipment, and software. OTF may request as an attachment at least one quote from a vendor for any equipment and software requested in the proposal.
