# Proposal Evaluation Worksheet

_Below is the worksheet used by OTF staff and the OTF Advisory Council when evaluating proposals. The scoring system for each area is on a scale from 0-5, where 0 is considered 'not applicable,' 1 is 'poor' or 'very weak,' and 5 is 'excellent' or 'very strong.' In general, proposals with higher aggregate scores will make it farther in the process._

### General Thoughts

Here is space for the reviewer to provide any general thoughts you have after reviewing a proposal. This is a space for any comments or questions not specifically addressed elsewhere in the review worksheet. Comments and questions posted here will be aggregated back to the Advisory Council and to the proposal authors.

**Things that you like about this proposal    
**Provide here any specific bits that got you really excited or that you like about this proposal.

**Things that concern you about this proposal    
**Provide here any specific bits that leave you feeling uneasy or that you do not like about this proposal.

**Red flags    
**Provide here anything you found to be cause for concern, dire warnings, notice of very serious dangers, and/or potential disasters.

### Specifics

Here is space for the reviewer to score and comment on specific aspects of the proposal. Comments and questions posted here will be aggregated back to the Advisory Council and to the proposal authors.

**Project overview \_\_\_**

Considerations for project overview: Are the project’s goals clear? Are the project's goals realistically met by the proposed solution? Does the proposal identify and acknowledge what the challenges will be? Does the proposal state if and how the proposed action is done at present, and what its associated limitations are? Is it clear and specific on who could benefit from the proposed effort and what its impact will be if the project is successful? Does the proposal cite any actual use cases? Does the proposal state how much it will cost and how long will it take?

**Objectives identified \_\_\_**

Considerations for objectives: Does the proposal state a clear set of objectives and associated tasks for the proposed effort?

**Appropriate methods and strategy \_\_\_**

Considerations for methods and strategy: Does the project propose methods appropriate to the goals and objectives? Does the project effectively apply its stated methods? Does the proposal suggest modified procedures in response to changing circumstances? Will the project fill a potential need or function that is currently unfilled, or is it reinventing the wheel? Is this creating a solution in search of a problem, or addressing an existing problem? Is the proposed solution viable in the real world?

**Technical feasibility \_\_\_**

Considerations for technical feasibility: Does the proposal clearly state the effort's technical goals? Are objectives articulated technically and succinctly? Does the proposal explain what is new in its approach and why it will succeed? Does the project increase or decrease known attack surfaces? Does it create new surfaces? Does the project buy tactical breathing space for existing problems or push towards convergence by changing the playing field? Does the project identify any expected or existing hurdles in achieving technical goals?

**Red team \_\_\_**

Considerations for red teaming: Does the proposal identify or recognize potential incentives to an adversary? Does the proposal consider potential illicit uses of the project? Does it discuss how an adversary might use the solution to further their own goals? Does the proposal identify potential unintended consequences of the project? Does the proposal identify and understand the proposed project's asymmetry? Given an attacker and defender of the project, does the proposal explain which role is more advantageous \(effort, cost, time, etc.\) and why? Does the proposal explain medium and long‐term strategies from both the attacker and defender point of view? Does the proposal discuss how to defeat the project and identify its deficiencies, or does it presume there are none?

**Usability \_\_\_**

Considerations for usability: Does the project demonstrate a high degree of usability/accessibility? Does the proposal demonstrate external demand i.e., demand originated from potential users rather than from would-be patrons of some hypothetical set of users? Does the project's focus impact either a small number of high value or at-risk users or a more general large numbers of users?

**Sustainability \_\_\_**

Considerations for sustainability: What is the project’s plan for future development/implementation? Does the proposal state if the project has other funding sources? Does the project currently receive any U.S. government funding? Does the project identify any cost sharing or matching for the proposed effort? Will the project be able to support itself by the requested funding, community sources, or other in-kind or indirect support? Does the project have a diversified funding/support stream i.e., how dependent would the project be on OTF funding?

**Collaboration \_\_\_**

Considerations for collaboration: Does or should the project support a collaborative open source community or partnership? How does the project facilitate inter-project collaboration, such as by talking with other projects doing similar things and identifying potential points of overlap, or planning to modularize code to enable reuse by others? Will the proposed deliverables benefit other OTF projects/goals beyond this one project? Will the proposed deliverables benefit other Internet freedom projects/goals beyond this one project?

**Rationale \_\_\_**

Considerations for rationale: Is the proposed project and its trajectory in-line with OTF’s principles and goals?

_OTF Program mission:_

The Open Technology Fund supports open technologies and communities that increase free expression, circumvent censorship, and obstruct repressive surveillance as a way to promote human rights and open societies.

_Guiding principles:_

Freedom of speech and expression, freedom of the press, open exchange of ideas and information, open Internet, Internet freedom, forward-thinking ideas and innovation, open philanthropy, transparency, accountability, alternative methodologies, new technologies, and collaboration

_Program goals are to support:_

Research into how Internet interference on modern communication networks occurs and to discover the technologies and methodologies that can circumvent said interference; Development of the technologies required to circumvent censorship and increase communication safety; and Implementation of circumvention tools for widespread use and adoption among non-technical citizens affected by censorship, interference, and illegitimate surveillance.

**Cost realism \_\_\_**

Considerations for cost realism: Is the budget realistic and commensurate with both the project needs and time frame? Is the project going to require funds immediately upon proposal approval?

**Qualifications \_\_\_**

Considerations for qualifications: Are project team member\(s\) clearly identified, along with work experience, in the proposal? Does the project’s team posses skills that uniquely qualify them to complete the proposed scope of work? Does the project team have a history of successful work related to the current initiative? Does the project have a core team \(leadership, developers, etc.\) dedicated to this project? Have team members worked with at-risk communities in the past?

**Evaluation \_\_\_**

Considerations for evaluation: Does the project articulate a measurable set of evaluation criteria and milestone metrics against results? Are the metrics both quantitative and qualitative? How difficult will an assessment of success or failure be?

**Recommendation: Yes or No**

Do you recommend supporting this proposal’s statement of work for the requested amount?
