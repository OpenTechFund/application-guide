# Funding Guidelines

**Deadlines      
**For the [Internet Freedom Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/requests/internet-freedom-fund) and [Core Infrastructure Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/requests/core-infrastructure-fund), OTF accepts applications \("concept notes"\) on a rolling basis with a recurring "round" deadline of every other month. The round deadlines are Jan 1, March 1, May 1, July 1, Sep 1, and Nov 1.

For the [Rapid Response Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/requests/rapid-response-fund), OTF accepts and reviews applications on an ongoing basis as they’re received. There are no deadlines for Rapid Response funding, ensuring that digital emergencies can be confronted as they arise.

For Fellowships, applications are accepted once annually. The [Information Controls Fellowship Program \(ICFP\)](https://www.opentech.fund/requests/icfp) window opens in the spring, typically from mid-February to mid-March. The [Digital Integrity Fellowship Program \(DIFP\) ](https://www.opentech.fund/fellowships/difp)window opens in the fall.

For [Labs](https://www.opentech.fund/labs), applications are accepted on an ongoing basis.

Please note that applications must be submitted via the OTF website no later than 23:59 \(11:59PM\) GMT on the deadline date listed on the request \(if there is one\). Also, please be aware that English is the language of record for all applications, and those submitted in other languages may not be reviewed as competitively as those submitted in English.

**Contracts, not Grants    
**It is important to note that OTF provides funding in the form of contracts, not grants. This means proposed objectives, deliverables, and associated timelines must be clearly stated in all applications. Funding is disbursed to OTF-supported efforts only upon completion of predetermined, contractually stated objectives.

**Projects, not Overhead    
**OTF generally does not support standalone costs which are not directly associated with the completion of objectives or deliverables. For example, indirect costs such as operational or administrative expenses are not supported. This is in part due to the contractual vehicle OTF relies upon to support projects in the Internet freedom space. This policy ensures that programmatic funds are focused on the objectives specifically outlined by Congress.

In the very limited instances where OTF determines that an overhead cost would be permitted, such costs cannot be greater than 10 percent of the overall cost of the project. Projects seeking an exception bear the burden of clearly demonstrating how the lack of such an inclusion will prevent the completion of the project’s objectives.
