If OTF is unable to support your proposed effort, there may still be a funder that can. OTF has therefore compiled a running list of funding sources related to Internet Freedom and other related topics such as journalism, human rights, policy, and various fellowships. 

You can access that list here: [https://www.opentech.fund/apply/alternative-sources-support](https://www.opentech.fund/apply/alternative-sources-support) 

We also send a monthly announcement of upcoming deadlines for both OTF funding mechanisms and those of other funders. To receive that email, sign up for the OTF-announce mailing list here: [https://groups.google.com/a/opentechfund.org/forum/\#!forum/otf-announce/join](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechfund.org/forum/#!forum/otf-announce/join)
