# Legal Lab

The Legal Lab is designed to provide internet freedom projects with legal advice on issues that may pop up over the course of an organization’s life. If you don’t speak legalese but want to make sure your project complies with local laws and regulations, the Legal Lab may be able to help. For example, you might have questions about your project or organization’s incorporation status, your app’s terms of service or privacy policy, or intellectual property ownership. The Legal Lab can help.
