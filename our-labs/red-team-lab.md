# Red Team Lab

The Red Team Lab is focused on ensuring the highest possible security standards for internet freedom technologies. To this end, the Red Team Lab supports independent technology audits for all of OTFâ€™s supported projects. Additionally, projects that are not not receiving OTF support but are otherwise relevant to internet freedom may apply for an audit. Ideally, audit findings are made publicly available after undergoing a responsible disclosure period to correct bugs found in the audit. As of this writing, the Red Team Lab has supported more than 85 audits, resulting in the identification and patching of nearly 2,000 privacy and security vulnerabilities.
