# Learning Lab

Every OTF-supported project produces something. Sometimes, the final product is a shiny new app that functions great, or perhaps a research write-up complete with graphics, charts, and eye-popping color. Other times, the final output might be a semi-functional beta release that still needs some work, or a research paper that could use a copy edit and cosmetic makeover. The Learning Lab will ensure that all OTF projects - big and small, successful or not - make good on our commitment to transparency and, most importantly, collective learning.
