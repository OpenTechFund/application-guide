# Community Lab

The Community Lab provides support for events - an essential component in building a stronger, more vibrant internet freedom community. Events supported by the Community Lab should strive to bring in new or underheard voices, whether they come from within or outside the relevant community. We especially love it when in-person events have the power to bring folks together while inspiring new partnerships and ideas.

We prioritize new projects that have not received funding in the past, as well as those being organized by the communities most affected by censorship and surveillance. Also please note that we give strong preference to events that have a code-of-conduct in place.
