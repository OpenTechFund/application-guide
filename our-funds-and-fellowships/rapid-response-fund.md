# Rapid Response Fund

The Rapid Response Fund is OTF’s digital emergency response mechanism, providing short-term, urgently needed support in the face of time-sensitive internet freedom violations. If you or your organization work in the fields of human rights, activism, or journalism and media and have recently experienced a digital emergency, our Rapid Response Fund may be able to help, either through direct financial support or through technological services conducted by our trusted service partners.

### _Key Questions_

When we review a Rapid Response application, there are a few questions we always keep in mind. Beyond determining whether the proposed effort fits within OTF’s remit, some of the most important to keep in mind before applying:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Does the proposed effort address an emergency situation? Is it time sensitive?** 

Unlike our other support mechanisms, the Rapid Response Fund addresses emergency, time-bound events and circumstances. Rapid Response does not support long-term projects or those that do not address a recent or ongoing internet freedom violation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Does the proposed effort aim to provide trainings or other longer-term digital security improvements?** 

The Rapid Response Fund does not support longer-term capacity-building efforts. If If you are interested in receiving support for longer-term capacity building, we invite you to consider exploring OTF’s Digital Integrity Fellowship Program.
