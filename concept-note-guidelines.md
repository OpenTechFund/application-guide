# Concept Note Guidelines

_Below are general guidelines to consider before submitting a concept note to OTF. _

---

There are three areas worth considering when drafting your concept note. They pertain to whether the proposed effort 1\) contributes or is relevant to OTF's mission, core values, and objectives; 2\) has technical merit; and 3\) is sustainable and fiscally realistic.

#### **1\) Relevance to OTF's Mission, Core Values, and Objectives **

**Organizational Profile**

* Where is the organization physically and legally based?
* If the organization is distributed, where is the main point of contact?
* Does the organization have any conflicts of interest with RFA, OTF, the Advisory Council, or other RFA-OTF projects?
* Is the project team an organization, community or an individual?

**Organizational Culture**

* Is the organization or its members known within any relevant communities? 
* If yes, what is their reputation and why? 
* What is the organization’s motivation and principles? What are the organization’s member\(s\)' motivation and principles?

**Project Profile**

* What are the goals and objectives of the project?
* Is it a technology research, development, or deployment project?
* Can project’s effort be explained to external audiences and non-technical people?
* What tools, if any, currently exist to solve this problem? How is this project different?
* What problem are they trying to solve and is the solution strategical or tactical?
* Is the project strategically or tactically important to OTF’s goals, principles and rationale and other OTF efforts? How?
* Does the effort have any overlap with existing OTF and/or USG supported projects?
* Is the overlap complementary or duplicative?
* What is complementary and can it be explained clearly? I.e. geographic focus, technology, organization profile, etc.
* What are the liabilities and risks of taking on this project? I.e. political personalities, financial concerns, technical controversial, etc.

**Human-Centric Focus**

* How does the project define its “users”?
* Is the project’s effort actually relevant to its defined users?
* Does the project’s defined user base align with the priorities of OTF?
* Could other priority OTF user groups benefit from this project?
* Are there existing users? If not, why?
* How do existing users find the user experience? Is it versatile and usable or useful but unusable?
* What steps has the projects taken to appeal to its defined users?
* Does the project have a plan to attract more users and make the project accessible? e.g. do usability testing, hold training sessions.
* What is their users threat model? Who are they being protected from and what are the consequences of failure?
* How is the project localized?
* How is the project representative of those it intended to help and is it appropriate?
* What experience does the project have with those it intends to help?

**Evaluation Criteria**

* Does the project measure success quantitatively or qualitatively?
* If not, then how would the project demonstrate success of the project to OTF? I.e. Does the project have potential quantitative or qualitative metrics?
* Is there a roadmap for the project? Is it public/open? If not, why?
* Does OTF have the capacity to comprehend and manage the project?

#### **2\) Sound Technical Merit**

* Does the project clearly articulate the technical problem, solution, and approach?
* How is the problem clearly justifiable?
* Does the project clearly articulate the technological objectives?
* Is it an open or closed development project? I.e. Open source like Android or open source like Firefox OS or closed like iOS.
* Does a similar technical solution already exist? If so, what are the differentiating factors?
* Is the effort to sustain an existing technical approach? If so, are these considered successful?
* Is the effort a new technical approach or improvement to an existing solution? If so, how?
* Is the effort a completely new technical approach fostering new solutions in the field?
* Does the project’s technical approach solve the problem?
* What are the limitations of the project’s technical approach and solution?
* What are the unintended or illicit uses and consequences of this technology?
* Has the project identified and/or developed any safeguards for these consequences?

**Technical Human Capacity **

* How many technologists are actively supporting the project?
* How many of the original technologists are still with the project?
* Is the current team sufficient to meet the project objectives?
* If more people are needed, how do you plan on obtaining the additional technical expertise?
* What other responsibilities and commitments do project technologists have? Technical Assets
* Is there any existing project code or technical assets?
* Is the existing code or technical assets proof of concept, academic, or production quality?

**Technical Evaluation**

* How does this technical approach and solution contribute to the larger technical community? And how is it measured?
* How does the project make the technical development process visible?
* How is the technical development progress measured by the project?

#### **3\)  Cost Realism and Sustainability** 

* Is the project receiving any financial support from the USG? How is this information disclosed?
* Is the project receiving any other financial support? How is this information disclosed?
* Can we discuss the project with existing financial supporters?
* What in-kind support or other revenue streams is the project receiving? I.e. volunteer developers, service or product sales
* How do they plan to support themselves in the future?
* What is the plan to sustain the project in the future? Is it reasonable and realistic?
* If OTF doesn’t support the project, will it still be realized?
* Does the project provide a detailed and realistic description of effort and schedule? I.e. is the project capable of creating a work plan including objectives, activities, and deliverable\(s\)?
* Is the asking amount reasonable and justified?
* Are they aware of and comfortable with the Intellectual property language in USG contracts?
